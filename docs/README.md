# StaticGenie

Creating dynamic websites is tiresome and getting more complex as time passes. Creating a basic web page as a way of publishing information should still be easy.

Given I have some time while unemployed I thought it would be good to create something open source. But what?

I know JavaScript pretty well (I think) and had might as well create a static website generator with a JavaScript developer in mind. I'm sure there are other JavaScript developers out there with the same problem as myself. Hopefully I can give back something of value to the programming community.
